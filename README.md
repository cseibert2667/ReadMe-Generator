## Description
A simple command line application that generates README files. When ran, the user will be presented with a series of prompts, then those inputs will be used to generate and write a README.md file to the current directory.

## Usage
To use the application, please run `node index.js` in the command line. To change the location of where you would like your file to be written, please indicate the file path on line 18 of index.js.

## Examples:
Please see the /examples directory within the repo to view a few files that were written using this application. Below is a gif that shows the process. (NOTE: Gif shows file being written to the 'examples' folder - this was only for the sake of demonstration. Current code writes file directly within the directory it is ran in.)
